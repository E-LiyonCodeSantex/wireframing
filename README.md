## 🧱 Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes act as the visual blueprint of a user interface, showcasing structure and interaction before a single line of code is written. Below are the essential elements and how they contribute to a well-designed layout:

### 🧭 Layout Structure
Defines the **overall skeletal framework** of the interface—grids, spacing, and alignment.
- **Example:** A two-column layout separates navigation on the left and content on the right, making the site easier to scan and interact with.

### 🔗 Navigation
Represents how users move between pages and sections—includes menus, links, breadcrumbs, and sidebars.
- **Example:** A sticky top navbar allows constant access to the homepage, search bar, and user profile, enhancing usability and reducing friction.

### 📦 Content Placement
Shows where key content blocks (text, images, CTAs) will appear, without final design details.
- **Example:** Placing featured listings above the fold ensures users see important offerings first, improving engagement and conversions.

### ⚙️ Functionality
Indicates key interactive elements—buttons, inputs, sliders, modals—without full logic behind them.
- **Example:** A wireframed date picker next to the “Book Now” button communicates the expected booking flow, even before it's coded.

Each element ensures the user experience is structured, predictable, and effective before visual design or development begins. Properly planned wireframes help teams iterate quickly, saving time and reducing costly revisions later.

## 🧭 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes vary in fidelity depending on the stage of the design process and the level of detail required. The two most common types are:

### 🔹 Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Purpose:** Used in the early stages of design to explore layout ideas and user flows.
- **Characteristics:** Simple sketches or grayscale layouts with placeholders for content, minimal styling, and no interactivity.
- **Tools:** Pen & paper, Balsamiq, whiteboards.
- **When to Use:** During brainstorming, early feedback sessions, or when validating structure and navigation.

### 🔹 High-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Purpose:** Used in later stages to refine the design and prepare for prototyping or development.
- **Characteristics:** Detailed visuals with real content, typography, spacing, and sometimes basic interactivity.
- **Tools:** Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch.
- **When to Use:** When presenting to stakeholders, preparing for usability testing, or handing off to developers.

## 🧾 Wireframe Type Used in This Project

For this project, a **High-Fidelity wireframe** was used.

This choice was intentional to:
- Focus on layout structure and user flow with visual design.
